  <h2>Welcome to my portfolio. My goal is to give you a glimpse into who I am as a <em>person</em>, as well as showcase the work I have done as a <em>programmer</em></h2>
  <h3>About Me</h3>

      <h4>Personal</h4>
      <p>I was born and raised in Seattle and have lived here or in the surrounding area for my whole life, save for the 2 1/2 years I lived in Portland after graduating college. I grew up a rabid Seattle sports fan and follow the Seahawks, Mariners, and Huskies year round. Most of my time is spent practicing coding, but in my free time you will find me reading a sports book, researching a new restaurant to order takeout, or getting outside with my dog and my girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Right now my <span class="emphasize">top 3</span> favorite places to get takeout are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="https://www.nacheauxpdx.com/">Nacheaux (Portland)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.asaderoprime.com/">Asadero (Seattle)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.ddir.com/">Dicks (Seattle)</a></li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Professional</h4>
      <p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.wwu.edu/">Western Washington University</a> in 2017 without any concrete plans for a career. After graduation I spent time figuring out what I wanted to do, which led me to move down to Portland with my girlfriend to start a career in Sales. After 2 1/2 years I learned Sales was not my passion, so I started to explore other avenues. This led me to enroll at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>. I had been interested in coding for a few years and after exploring some free resources online I decided to take the plunge and began to pursue a career in tech development.</p>
